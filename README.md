# phase-1-project

####This project is a simple web-based application designed to help content creators manage and track their social media post ideas. Users can submit ideas, update their status, rate their performance, and add comments â€” all from one interface.

#### By **Michael OKello**

## Project Description

The Social Media Idea Manager allows users to create and manage content ideas tailored for different social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, or TikTok. Each idea includes a platform, content type, and description. Once an idea is submitted, users can later update its status (posted or not), rate how well it performed using a 5-star rating system, and leave comments about its performance.

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and uses a publicly hosted JSON Server API to store and retrieve data asynchronously in JSON format.

##Features

- Add new content ideas with details like platform, content type, and description
- Mark ideas as posted or not posted

- Add comments on the performance of posted ideas
- Persist all data to a public API
